/**
 * This program "fakes" a text adventure game using Javascript and GPT.
 * It provides a basic loop which prompts the user for commands and then prompts
 * GPT with some high level instructions, the last few GPT responses
 * for context, and the users command.
 *
 * If the user "plays along" the experience is suprisingly similar to a true
 * text adventure game. But the user can easily "break" the game by issuing
 * outlandish commands.
